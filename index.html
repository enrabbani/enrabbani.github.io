                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p id = "greeting">I recently graduated from Buchholz High School and am starting college in Fall 2025. I am majoring in mechanical engineering at the University of Florida. I'm currently interested in mechatronics which is a field that combines mechanics, electronics, and computer systems as well as robotics which involves similar fields. In high school, I particularly enjoyed doing VEX VRC Robotics where I got to work with educational electronic components and cut metal to make a robot capable of performing a specific task like picking up rings and putting them on ring stands. Additionally, I enjoyed my AP Physics 2 class where I learned about electricity and magnetism, allowing me to understand the connection between physics concepts and real-world applications.</p>
                <p>At UF, I plan on expanding on what I've learned by joining design teams and working on hands-on engineering projects. I'm especially interested in learning CAD to improve build quality, programming PID controllers for accurate autonomous control periods, and understanding how to build a PTO (Power Take-off) system for power distribution in mechanical systems</p>
                <p>If you would like to reach out, contact me at emanrabbani1@gmail.com, and for UF-related inquiries, please use emanrabbani@ufl.edu.</p></div>

                        <p>During high school, I managed to accumulate a variety of skills. In my coursework, I gained a solid foundation in Calculus and Physics with the help of my excellent teachers and my own interest and curiosity. During middle school, I learned Microsoft Powerpoint, Word, and Excel and am certified through Certiport.  As a student at Buchholz High School, I joined the Academy of Entrepreneurship and got certified in Entrepreneurship Small Business (ESB), National Registry of Food Safety Professionals (NRFSP), ServSafe, and Project Management. In VEX VRC Robotics, I took on the role of Lead Designer and learned how to design, build, program, and analyze a robot's performance. After the season ended, I started learning CAD to design a simple drivebase which I prototyped and began building in future sessions. </p>

                        <p>HTML - During Summer 2025, I learned HTML 5 in order to make my own website. I learned how to display text, images, videos, and files from google drive. Additionally, I learned about dividers, sections, classes, website icons, navbar, etc. Also, I learned about accessibility practices like aria-label and alt to make my website more accessible to those who use screen readers. My HTML file for this website includes a small Javascript section that handles the image slider, text change, navigation bar, and greeting. By coding this website myself, I've been able to expand on my knowledge of programming and fully personalize the website.</p>

                        <p>CSS - During Summer 2025, I learned CSS in order to style my website. I created a simple color scheme for this website using shades of blue and implemented it with CSS styling. Additionally, all of the icons needed CSS styling from a stylesheet in order for them to be formatted correctly. I learned about flexboxes, formatting, layouts, etc. in order to make the website more aesthetic. Additionally, I implemented and used CSS to make the website dynamically resize and adjust for other platforms such as tablets or smartphones where the screen size is significantly smaller. </p>

                        <p>C++ - During my time in VEX VRC Robotics, I learned C++ through the VexCode program where I started programming simple functions for the robot such as responding to controller input. In my senior year, I made more complex autonomous routines that lasted 45-60 seconds long. Later, I experimented with the Jackson Area Robotics (JAR) Template that included a simple PID and odometry system. Despite not coding it myself, I was able to learn from the JAR Template by modifying different settings for voltage and driver control functions. I used the template to improve accuracy during autonomous portions raising our skills score from 25 to 41. Now, I plan on learning C++ using online resources to give me a solid foundation before moving on to learning PIDs in more detail so that I can implement one myself.</p>

                        <p>After our last robotics competition in February 2025, I began experimenting with Fusion360, a CAD Program, that allowed me to start prototyping the drivebase. While I did not have time to finish it, I got started with learning the basics of the program. A sample image is available below:</p>

                    <div class = "skillstextlist" id = "calculus-text" style="display: none;">
                        <p>During my senior year of highschool, I took Calculus BC which covers Calculus I and Calculus II. I found this subject to be fascinating because of its applications. Particularly, I found the washer, disk, and shell methods to be excellent applications of integral Calculus. Additionally, Calculus is particularly useful in understanding physics and the derivations of fundamental formulas. </p>
                        <p>I found Calculus II's unit on parametric equations to be quite insightful: using my knowledge of parametric equations, I began finding a way to model the path of a robot takes using motor rotations. The idea was to use equations to calculate the distance the robot traveled using motor rotations and then use parametric equations to model the x and y functions for the robot separately. Unfortunately, the data my friend and I obtained from the motor rotations didn't produce the results we were looking for, but the function I came up with in Desmos produces accurate results assuming it has the appropriate data.</p>
                        <p>Here is one of the models - this one assumes you have changes in distances and angles:</p>

                        <p>During my junior and senior years of highschool, I took AP Physics 1 and 2 which covered mechanics, electricity and magnetism, optics, and some of modern physics. Particularly, I found Physics 2 to be intriguing because of the connection between electricity and magnetism to electrical equipment. During Spring Break, I took the time to relearn electricity and magnetism using videos by Walter Lewin on MIT OCW to solidify the concepts.</p>
                        <p>As I progressed through the lectures, I began to understand how the concepts translate to the real world. For example, in Walter Lewin's lecture on Magnetic Fields, Lorentz Force, Torques, and Electric Motors (DC) showed me how the concept of currents creating magnetic fields translates to motors. Additionally, I learned about the torque reversal problem in DC motors and how that is typically solved with commutators or alternating-current systems. Through engaging with supplemental materials, I was able to take my learning to the next level.</p>

                    <p>During my senior year, I embarked on a long and challenging journey with Robotics. At first, I wasn't sure if I was ready to be the Lead Designer of the team, but over time, I grew into the role and learned a great deal along the way. My teammate and friend, Max Nikitin, was another member of the team and he acted as our driver for most of the season. However, we didn't just build one robot together; we built two. Our first robot was structurally weak and more susceptible to being pushed around in matches. Realizing this, we worked together to forge a new robot that was strong and capable of effectively performing the functions of the game even while facing interference from the opposing team.</p>
                    <p>After the new robot was constructed, there were still crucial aspects of our strategy that needed improvement: driving and programming. Max, being our primary driver of the team, got lots of practice with maneuvering the robot and completing objectives. In addition, I programmed the autonomous periods of the robot to improve our scores during matches and skills runs. All of this allowed us to improve our skills score from 25 to 41 at the last competition. While this wasn't enough to qualify for the states competition, both Max and I were able to learn valuable skills from our time working together — which was what really mattered. </p>
                    <p>After competing in five competitions, we both learned the importance of teamwork, communication, designing, and planning as crucial components of the engineering process.</p>

                            <li>The main objective of the Vex High Stakes game was to take circular rings and put them on mobile ring stands.</li>
                            <li>We divided this task into three different systems: the intake (picking up rings from the field), the conveyor belt (scoring those rings onto the mobile ring stands), and the clamp (holding onto the mobile ring stand to allow the robot to score).</li>
                        </ul>

                <div class = "text-box">
                        <p><b>How?</b></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Came up with basic designs in Microsoft OneNote through discussions over Discord.</li>
                            <li>Our first robot was a prototype and was able to perform the basic functions of the game but was structurally weak and frequently curved to the left instead of driving straight.</li>
                            <li>By contrast, our second robot had improved structural quality and performed the main functions of the game consistently and reliability. However, towards the end we had similar problems with the robot curving to one side instead of driving straight.</li>
                        </ul>

                            <li><b>Positives:</b> Second robot was structurally sound and performed the main objectives of the game consistently and reliably.</li>
                            <li><b>Negatives:</b> Our final robot had a faulty drivebase and lacked speed. Additionally, our robot couldn't perform the advanced tasks of the game such as climbing or putting rings on wall stakes.</li>
                            <li>Overall, both Max and I learned a lot from this experience. We learned critical lessons about drivetrain geometry, frame rigidity, and the importance of precise mechanical planning.</li>
